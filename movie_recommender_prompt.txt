## **1. Product Name**

**Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning & React JS**

---

## **2. Overview**

The Movie Recommendation System is a web-based application that allows users to enter a movie name and receive a list of similar movie recommendations. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze movie features and similarities, providing personalized and relevant recommendations without requiring internet connectivity.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **machine learning**, **data processing**, and **modern frontend development** using React JS.

## **3. Objectives**

* Provide accurate movie recommendations based on user input
* Implement a lightweight and fast ML-based recommendation engine
* Build a responsive and user-friendly UI
* Operate fully offline after setup
* Demonstrate ML + frontend integration for learning and portfolio use

---

## **4. Key Features**

* 🎥 Movie search by name
* 🤖 Machine learning–based similarity matching
* 📊 Content-based recommendation system
* ⚡ Fast recommendations with preprocessed data
* 💻 Fully offline web application
* 🎨 Clean, responsive UI with animations

---

## **5. User Flow**

1. User opens the web application
2. User enters a movie name in the search box
3. System validates the input
4. ML model processes the input movie
5. System recommends a list of similar movies
6. Results are displayed with smooth UI animations

* Auto-suggestion or validation for invalid movie names

### 6.2 Recommendation Engine

* Content-based filtering using movie metadata
* Similarity calculation using ML algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity)
* Pre-trained model loaded locally

### 6.3 Recommendation Output

* Display recommended movies as a list or cards
* Show movie title (optional: genre, rating)

### 6.4 Offline Support

* Dataset and ML model stored locally
* No external API dependency
